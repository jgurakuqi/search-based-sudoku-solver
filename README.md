- Create a matrix class, which will be used to create sudoku fields and to store the domains of each 
  empty cell.
- Solve the problem using a Forward Checking approach, where every variable will have a domain, to be 
  updated on each "move", in order to detect any constraint violation. In case of constraint violation,
  there will be a backtracking, reaching the most recent "snapshot" of the field, to proceed with other
  values.

## Requirements

Write a solver for sudoku puzzles using a constraint satisfaction approach based on constraint propagation and backtracking, and one based on Relaxation Labeling. compare the approaches, their strengths and weaknesses.

A sudoku puzzle is composed of a square 9x9 board divided into 3 rows and 3 columns of smaller 3x3 boxes. The goal is to fill the board with digits from 1 to 9 such that

each number appears only once for each row column and 3x3 box;
each row, column, and 3x3 box should containg all 9 digits.
The solver should take as input a matrix withwhere empty squares are represented by a standars symbol (e.g., ".", "_", or "0"), while known square should be represented by the corresponding digit (1,...,9). For example:
                                            37. 5.. ..6
                                            ... 36. .12
                                            ... .91 75.
                                            ... 154 .7.
                                            ..3 .7. 6..
                                            .5. 638 ...
                                            .64 98. ...
                                            59. .26 ...
                                            2.. ..5 .64

# Hints for Constraint Propagation and Backtracking:
- Each cell should be a variable that can take values in the domain (1, ‚Ä¶ ,9).
- The two types of constraints in the definition form as many types of constraints:
  - Direct constraints impose that no two equal digits appear for each row, column, and box.
  - Indirect constrains impose that each digit must appear in each row, column, and box.
- You can think of other types of (pairwise) constraints to further improve the constraint propagation phase.
- Note: most puzzles found in the magazines can be solved with only the constraint propagation step.

# Hints for Relaxation Labeling:
- Each cell should be an object, the values between 1 and 9 labels.
- The compatibility ùëüùëñùëó(ùúÜ, ùúá) should be 1 if the assignments satisfy direct constraints, 0 otherwise.

## Installation

In order to run this project a Python 3 and a basic C++ compiler are required, and also Python 3 requires the installation of the numpy module:
```bash
pip3 install numpy
```

## Usage

In order to run the Constraint Propagation based solver:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o out
./out
```

For the Relaxation labeling based solver:
```bash
python main.py
```
